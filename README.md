## 📋 Requirements

- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 13+ (for building)
- CMake 3.16+ (for building)
- Optional: Dobby library for enhanced hooking capabilities

## 🔧 Installation

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roblox-executor.git
   cd roblox-executor
   ```

2. Configure the build:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```

4. The compiled library (`libmylibrary.dylib`) will be available in the `build/lib` directory.

### Installation on Device

#### Jailbroken Device
1. Copy `libmylibrary.dylib` to your device
2. Inject the library into Roblox using a tool like libhooker, Substitute, or similar injection methods

#### Non-Jailbroken Device
For non-jailbroken devices, additional steps are required:
1. Sign the library with a developer certificate
2. Use a sideloading method compatible with your iOS version
3. Follow the specific integration instructions for your deployment method

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Script Execution

```cpp
// Initialize the execution engine
auto engine = std::make_shared<iOS::ExecutionEngine>();
engine->Initialize();

// Execute a script
std::string script = "print('Hello from Roblox Executor!')";
auto result = engine->Execute(script);

if (result.m_success) {
    std::cout << "Script executed successfully" << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "Execution failed: " << result.m_error << std::endl;
}
```

### Script Management

```cpp
// Initialize script manager
auto scriptManager = std::make_shared<iOS::ScriptManager>();
scriptManager->Initialize();

// Add a script
iOS::ScriptManager::Script newScript(
    "MyScript",                   // Name
    "print('Hello, Roblox!')",   // Content
    "Simple hello world script",  // Description
    "YourUsername",               // Author
    iOS::ScriptManager::Category::Utilities  // Category
);
scriptManager->AddScript(newScript);

// Execute the script
scriptManager->ExecuteScript("MyScript");
```

### UI Integration

```objective-c
// Initialize UI controller
UIController *controller = [[UIController alloc] init];
[controller show];

// Handle button press events
controller.scriptButtonPressHandler = ^{
    // Show script selection UI
    [controller showScriptSelector];
};
```

### AI Features

```cpp
// Initialize AI integration
auto ai = std::make_shared<iOS::AIFeatures::AIIntegrationInterface>();
ai->Initialize();

// Generate a script
ai->ProcessQuery("Create a script that makes the player jump higher", 
    [](const std::string& response) {
        std::cout << "Generated script: " << response << std::endl;
    });
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

This project includes advanced security features:

- Anti-debugging detection
- Code integrity verification
- Protection against function hooking
- Tampering detection and response mechanisms

These security measures help protect the library against reverse engineering and detection.

## 🧩 Architecture

The project is organized into several key components:

- **VM**: Lua virtual machine implementation
- **ExecutionEngine**: Core script execution system
- **ScriptManager**: Script storage and management
- **Hooks**: Function hooking mechanisms
- **Memory**: Memory manipulation utilities
- **UI**: User interface components
- **AI Features**: Artificial intelligence capabilities
- **Security**: Anti-tamper and anti-detection mechanisms

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

The following build options are available:

- `USE_DOBBY`: Enable Dobby for function hooking (ON by default)
- `USE_LUAU`: Use Luau (Roblox's Lua) instead of standard Lua (ON by default)
- `ENABLE_AI_FEATURES`: Enable AI-powered features (ON by default)
- `ENABLE_ADVANCED_BYPASS`: Enable advanced bypass techniques (ON by default)
- `BUILD_TESTING`: Build test executables (OFF by default)
- `BUILD_DOCS`: Build documentation (OFF by default)

Set these options when configuring with CMake:
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DUSE_DOBBY=ON -DENABLE_AI_FEATURES=ON
```
