# Build Failure Fixes

This PR addresses the build failures that occurred after removing the `fix_paths.sh` script. Here's a summary of the changes:

## 1. Fixed Include Paths

The main issue was that many files were using incorrect relative paths to include `objc_isolation.h` after the path-fixing script was removed. We fixed this by:

- Calculating the correct relative path for each file based on its directory depth
- Updating all include statements across the iOS subdirectories:
  - Files in `source/cpp/ios/` now use `#include "../objc_isolation.h"`
  - Files in `source/cpp/ios/*/` now use `#include "../../objc_isolation.h"`
  - Files in `source/cpp/ios/*/*/` now use `#include "../../../objc_isolation.h"`

## 2. Improved CMake Configuration

To prevent similar issues in the future and improve build stability:

- Added `${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/source/cpp` to the include directories, making it easier to include files from this directory
- Added stronger compiler warnings and error flags (`-Wall -Wextra -Werror`) to catch potential issues earlier
- Added iOS-specific compiler definitions for better compatibility

## 3. Added Central Include Guard

Created a new `include_guard.h` header that can be used in future development as a central way to include platform-specific headers without worrying about relative paths.

## Lessons Learned

When removing utility scripts like `fix_paths.sh`, it's important to first understand what they were fixing and implement a proper solution before removal. In this case, the script was critical for ensuring the correct include paths across different directory levels.
